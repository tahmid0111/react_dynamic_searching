# React + Vite + tailwind css

I just tried to make a simple e-commerce project.

I want to make a perfect folder structure for my react project.

I used some fake api for this project.

there is a great use of react-router v6 and I used oultet functionality from react-router-dom for better user experience and faster loading.
